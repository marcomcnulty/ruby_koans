# EXTRA CREDIT:
#
# Create a program that will play the Greed Game.
# Rules for the game are in GREED_RULES.TXT.
#
# You already have a DiceSet class and score function you can use.
# Write a player class and a Game class to complete the project.  This
# is a free form assignment, so approach it however you desire.

# TIL:
# - Ruby's default behavior for an exception object is to return its message when you try to access the object in a
#   string-like context. So assigning the error to a variable or printing it will implicitly call message on the error
#   object.
# - NoMethodError is raised if trying to use += operator on a variable where you have defined a getter/setter because
#   it is shorthand for var = var + 1 so as var has not been previously defined and assigned a value within the local
#   scope, Ruby implicitly creates a local var variable set to nil, which does not respond to `+`.
# - When iterating over a collection, the block variable is only a copy of the item in the original data structure.
#   Therefore, if you want to update the item within the block and have the change persist, you need to explicitly
#   access the original object and modify the item, or use methods that modify in place like map!.
# - Be careful to never pass a keyword argument to a method that has only set up an optional argument. Doing so will
#   cause Ruby to interpret this as you passing a single hash argument rather than a keyword argument, which won't raise
#   an error but could cause unexpected behaviour.
# - Working with StringIO in irb is a bit of a pain because it displays the result of every expression after it's
#   evaluated, which messes up the output.
# - In my case, I wasn't bothered about testing the exact output of the message, but if you wanted to you could do:
#   ouput.rewind then ouput.read to get the actual string content of the StringIO object rather than the StringIO string
#   object itself.
# - Lambdas are awesome!
# - When nesting classes, it often helps to pass a reference of the enclosing class to the nested class, so that the
#   nested class is aware of its context.
# - Variables defined in a for loop block are accessible outside of the block because for loops do not create their own
#   scope.
# - Methods:
#   - all? -> condition satisfied within all iterations of the block
#   - any? -> at least one condition satisfied within all iteration of the block
#   - max_by -> returns the object that gives the maximum value from the given block
#   - min_by -> returns the object that gives the minimum value from the given block
