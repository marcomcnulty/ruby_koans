# TIL:
# - Ruby handling of symbols (unique objects, GC, creating a symbol if not already exists when comparing)
# - Why using strings over symbols can be more memory safe (GC, not unique objects)
# - Avoid memory bloat by creating dynamic symbols in a loop or from user input
# - This is why Rails creates string from parameter keys
# - MRI stands for Matz's Ruby Interpreter (also known as CRuby). It is the reference implementation of Ruby, written in
#   C. Other implementations include: JRuby, Rubinius, TruffleRuby and mruby. They either focus more on performance or
#   serve a lightweight implentation that can be embedded in other applications
#   Method and Constant names become automatically available as symbols

  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why do we convert the list of symbols to strings and then compare
  # against the string value rather than against symbols?

  # A: When directly comparing against a symbol, Ruby will create a new symbol if it doesn't already exist. Symbols
  # are unique, immutable objects (only one copy of the key is kept in memory). Once a symbol is created, it exists for the duration of the program i.e. it's not
  # garbage collected. (Ruby < 1.8 never GC! Ruby >= 2.2 can reclaim unused symbols, especially dynamically created ones
  # e.g. String#to_sym or :#{dynamic_string})
  #
  # This means that performing a comparison similar to above could result in false being returned on the first run, but
  # true returned on the second run because the a copy of the symbol we were comparing has been created during the first
  # run and now exists in the symbol table (an internal data structure maintained by the Ruby interpreter).
  #
  # Comparing two strings (O(n)) is less efficient than comparing two symbols (O(1)) because you need to compare the
  # contents of the string char by char, whereas with symbols, you're just comparing two integer memory addresses.
  # In the example above, you also incur the overhead of creating each symbol to a string before the assertion. However,
  # due to strings not being unique and getting garbage collected, it is more memory safe to use strings.

  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why is it not a good idea to dynamically create a lot of symbols?

  # A: Doing this can lead to memory bloat and as the symbol table grows, performance can be degraded as Ruby internals
  # are affected (symbol lookups etc.)
  # Dynamically creating symbols based on user input or other external sources can pose security risks. DoS attack
  # vulnerability - malicious input could potentially lead to the creation of a large number of symbols, affecting
  # performance or crashing the server due to memory exhaustion.
